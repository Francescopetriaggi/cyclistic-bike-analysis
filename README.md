# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

## Project Overview

This case study was developed as the final project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/HWFIH75ZXNZH).  
The goal was to analyze user behavior within Chicago’s Cyclistic bike-share program to understand how casual riders differ from annual members, and how to encourage more users to become subscribers.

The analysis was done using SQL on Google BigQuery and supported with visualizations created in Google Sheets.

## Business Task

> How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
> What strategies can help convert more casual users into annual members?

By identifying key behavioral patterns, the company aims to design data-driven marketing offers tailored to each user segment.

##  Tools Used

- **Google BigQuery** – for data cleaning and analysis
- **SQL** – to prepare and explore the dataset
- **Google Sheets** – for visualizations
- **Google Docs** – to document findings in both English and Italian

## Key Insights

- **Casual riders** tend to take longer rides, mostly during **weekends** and **summer months**, suggesting recreational or tourist use.
- **Annual members** use the service more frequently for shorter rides during weekdays — likely for commuting.
- Electric bikes are the most popular among both groups, but casual riders also prefer classic bikes for longer weekend rides.

## Files Included

- `Cyclistic_Report_EN.pdf` – Full report in **English**
- `Cyclistic_Report_IT.pdf` – Full report in **Italian**
